# Architecture Summary

The architecture diagram represents a Clinic management system. Key components include:

- **Support Modules**: REST API and multiple UI patterns.
- **SpringBird AP**: Acts as a controller handling requests.
- **Node.js**: Manages middleware and services.
- **MongoDB**: Stores prescription models and documents.
- **MySQL Database**: Contains patient, doctor, and appointment data.
- **Service Layer**: Interfaces between controllers and models, handling calls and user interactions.
- **Models**: Include patient, doctor, and appointment models.
- **Dashboards**: Admin and user-specific interfaces (e.g., doctor dashboard).
- **External APIs**: Integrated for additional functionality.

## Numbered Flow of Data and Control

1. User interacts with the dashboard (e.g., Admin or Doctor).
2. Request is sent to the SpringBird AP controller.
3. Controller forwards the request to the Node.js service layer.
4. Service layer processes the request and interacts with MySQL Database for patient, doctor, and appointment data.
5. Service layer also queries MongoDB for prescription models and documents.
6. Data is retrieved and processed, then sent back through the service layer.
7. Response is routed back to the SpringBird AP controller.
8. Controller delivers the response to the appropriate dashboard for user interaction.
